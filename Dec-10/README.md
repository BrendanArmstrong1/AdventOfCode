# Day Ten of Advent of code

## Part 1

Matching brackets. I scanned through the array and matched any components replacing both with zeros and
scanned past the zeros.

## Part 2

After getting rid of the bad array's. I rescanned through the array backwards building up points. then
I made my own sorting algorythm to sort it. The value ended up being the 22<sup>nd</sup> index.
