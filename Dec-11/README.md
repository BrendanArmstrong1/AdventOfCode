# Day Elevel of Advent of code

## Part 1

Goodness. This has taken me a long time because i systematically kept leaving out
the case where just the column was either 0 or 9. I kept getting seg faults, so that
really should have been a clue. But at least I had really good practice writting matrix
loops...

## Part 2

This part was super easy after learning my code inside and out on part 1. Just waited
to see if there were 100 flashes in a single step and that was the answer.
