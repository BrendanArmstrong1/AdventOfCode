# Day Four of Advent of code

## Part 1

So this one took a boatload of time. I wanted to make a stable code base from the beginning so I was thinking ahead. I made my code
into functions that I could call in the main function and took my time structuring everything into nice refactor able code.
Eventually I managed to get everything printed out on the screen and submitted the answer. So part two took like 2 minutes to
change a few things.


## Part 2

Part 2 just was extremely easy. Probably as a result of my solid writing in the first part. All I needed to do was add if the
board was found and keep track of how many were found. Once the last one was found, I had my answer.
