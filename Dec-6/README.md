# Day Six of Advent of code

## Part 1

I'm actually doing this the morning after on the 7th. I was modifying my vimrc so that it was more confortable for me and it ended
up being a big thing. This challenge was really easy. Part 2 is essentially this but changing the sum and hist variable to long
long's so that they have the bit depth to represent the huge values.
