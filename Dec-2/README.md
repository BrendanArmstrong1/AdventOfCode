# Day two of Advent of code

## Part 1

Today I found out how to use curl with a session ID to retreive my data from AoC website (sorry if this is bad form, I didn't spam
the site, and I saved the output to a file). now i just need to do the puzzle.

Amazing, Part 1 is just reading the first letter of the input string and chaning the corresponding value. This script works and it
worked on the first try.

## Part 2

Part 2 changes things up, instead of down and up changing the depth, they only affect the aim(angle) of the submarine now. Forward
changes the horizontal position and also now changes the depth based on the aim. Fun puzzle but I didnt need to use strtok which
is a little sad. Hopefully I can flex my C in future challenges.
