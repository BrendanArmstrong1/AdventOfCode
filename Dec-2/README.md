# Day two of Advent of code

## Part 1

Today I found out how to use curl with a session ID to retreive my data from AoC website (sorry if this is bad form, I didn't spam
the site, and I saved the output to a file). now i just need to do the puzzle.

Amazing, Part 1 is just reading the first letter of the input string and chaning the corresponding value. This script works and it
worked on the first try.
