# Day Five of Advent of code

## Part 1

Fun challenge, I just recently threw away conquerors of completion(CoC) and tried coding without the auto formatting. Im glad that
I have this challenge to give me some exercise in coding in almost pure vim. It feels good. Pretty easy challenge but I got a bit
stuck on the second part.

## Part 2

Because of a typo!!! I was stuck because I started one of my loop variables at 1 instead of 0 for my new diagonal pieces. haha,
that was not a good moment when I saw that. I spent a lot of time debugging. I even printed the whole thing out to my terminal
with ANSI colors to see all of the lines in the grid. But In the end I got two stars!
